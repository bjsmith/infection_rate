<ul>
  <li>Location: Country, state, territory, or other subnational group. The list will show only those locations meeting the traveller threshold set at the top of the page. Data is sourced from Johns Hopkins University, state and national health authorities, and Statistics New Zealand; see Method & Approach for more details.</li>
  <!--<li>Population density: Location population density as reported by Our World In Data</li>-->
  <li>Active cases: Currently active Covid-19 cases.
  We gather daily new cases from Johns Hopkins University. For selected low-prevalence locations, these are replaced by the currently active cases
  as recorded on local ministries of health. This is because the Johns Hopkins data does not distinguish between local and imported cases.
  Distinguishing between them is important for understanding location prevalence.
  The "Proposed System" tab provides an option for disabling this adjustment and using Johns Hopkins data only.
  <br />
  Then:<br />
  (1) We calculate total reported cases minus fatalities and recoveries.<br />
  (2) We calculate total reported cases over the last three weeks.
  <br />
  We use the <em>lower</em> of these. Usually, (1) is lower, and it is more accurate. In some cases, (e.g., New South Wales), recoveries are not recorded properly.
  To maintain an accurate count, we use the second definition where that is lower.
  </li>
  <li>
    Prevalence (infections / mil): Estimated true infections divided by the population size. (If the applicable option is selected on the Proposed intervention tab, this column reflects the prevalence of covid-19 in the community, with cases from external sources outside the country/location and held in that locations's own managed isolation/quarantine manually excluded from the data used to calculate the prevalence rating)
  </li>
  <li>
    Prevalence rating: This is marked "unknown" when the location's health system reliability is not considered trustworthy. Otherwise, it can be Covid-free, indicating zero active cases, or other levels up to Level 4. Thresholds are determined on the "Proposed System" page. (If the applicable option is selected on the Proposed intervention tab, this column reflects the prevalence of covid-19 in the community, with cases from external sources outside the country/location and held in that locations's own managed isolation/quarantine manually excluded from the data used to calculate the prevalence rating)
  </li>
  <li>
    Outlook rating: To provide an 'early warning', recent trends in daily confirmed cases are projected two weeks into the future using a simple linear model. 
    Then the prevalence over the next two weeks is calculated based on this projection. 
    The Outlook rating may be used to identify Level 1, 2, and 3 locations where the outbreak appears to be worsening and which may slip into a higher prevalence level in the next two weeks. 
    Use this "outlook rating" with extreme caution as the linear projection method has not been validated.
    (This data is based on prevalence information drawn from all active cases, without distinguishing between active and local cases. Thus, for any locations where most or all cases are in MIQ, the outlook is likely to estimate a higher incoming prevalence level than is really applicable)
  </li>
  <li>
    2019 Monthly arrivals: This specifies the monthly arrivals in the corresponding month in 2019. This will correspond to the calendar month of the currently selected date as shown on the top right of the app.
  </li>
  <li>
    Expected number of cases entering the traveller journey: This displays the expected number of cases that <em>enter the traveller journey</em>. This means cases that (1) arrive at new Zealand's border, or (2) if a pre-departure PCR test is held, the number of cases screened out by that test plus the remaining cases that arrive in New Zealand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Assigned intervention: This is the change proposed for travellers from that location.
    If no intervention is assigned then the proposal is to continue with the current system for that location, except, possibly, to introduce a pre-departure PCR test.
    A change is only considered if data from the location is considered trustworthy,
    and if the location has at least 2,000 travellers travelling to New Zealand in the relevant month for 2019.
    If a location meets these criteria than an intervention is assigned based on the prevalence thresholds specified in the "Proposed System" tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Expected arrivals per month (based on 2019): 
    Estimated arrivals per month, after any interventions have been assigned, assuming the sum of current travel levels plus a fraction of the difference between current and 2019 travel. This can be adjusted by varying the proportion of expected travellers from each risk level on the “Proposed System” tab
  </li>
  <li>
    Expected cases exiting MIQ per month: 
    This is the estimated number of cases exiting MIQ into the community even after applicable managed isolation and quarantine measures have been taken.
    This is an average only, and the true number in any given month could be more or less.
    It considers the prevalence in the location, 
    the volume of travel from that location likely following the application of an intervention (which can be specified on the "Proposed System tab"),
    and the effectiveness of the selected traveller journey (Open, 1-, 5-, or 14-day MIQ).
    It is likely to be under-estimated in countries with an "untrustworthy" data reliability rating.
