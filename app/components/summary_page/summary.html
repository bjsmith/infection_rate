New Zealand is facing increasing economic recession as a result of its strict border policy which, at
        present, necessitates two weeks’ quarantine for all travellers who enter the country. We developed a
        model to explore the effect of selective border opening to travellers from countries with a low
        prevalence of covid-19 on the rate of undetected cases that pose a risk of spread to the community.
        The risk posed could be mitigated by introducing RT-PCR testing for covid-19 on either side of the
        border, increasing infection control at the border, and by varying times of quarantine on arrival to
        New Zealand. The length of quarantine is proposed to be commensurate with the prevalence in the
        traveller’s country.
